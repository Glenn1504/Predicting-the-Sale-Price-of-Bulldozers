# Predicting-the-Sale-Price-of-Bulldozers
How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for? This is a regression problem. Datasets include historical bulldozer sales examples up to 2011, from January 1 2012 to April 30 2012, and from May 1 2012 to November 2012.
